# redirect_to_facebook.github.io

I create this repo to redirect to facebook main page, because of microsoft edge can only add one site in sidebar with one url, but i want to use 2 site, so i need one redirect file to make it work :))

# Instructions

- create a github page, change the value of content to 10 or something
- make a sidebar shotcut by adding the current page
- open the shotcut, in 10s, change the the web view to desktop view
- change the value of content to 0
